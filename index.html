			<p>I live in Rotterdam, but I'm from the beautiful Hungary, Budapest. Previously I have worked in event management, but one day I decided to swtich and start studying something very different, very new: <span id=coding>coding</span>. I've been following different courses in tech. I already have experience with:
		<span id=skills>Wireframing, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery</span> and <span id=skills>Jira.</span> </p>
		<p>I want to start working in IT as soon as I can, even if it's a bottom line position. </p>
		<p>I want to start, now!</p>

		<div id=p2>
			<p> When I'm not behind my computer I'm sitting in <span id=dutch>Dutch lesson</span>. I am in love with languages, I guess. I speak Hungarian, English and French fluently, and the Dutch is approaching now quickly!</p>
		</div>
		<div id=p3>
			<p>Second option if you don't find near my laptop is to look in the kitchen. Most probably I am <span id=cooking>cooking</span> something very healthy and very delicious.</p>
